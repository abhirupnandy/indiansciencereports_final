            This portal is a repository of quantitative indicators of research performance of Indian academic
            and research institutions along with their relative positions. The portal is developed and maintained
            by Information Systems Research Group at Banaras Hindu University, India. The portal is one of its kind
            and provides a comprehensive map of research performance of Indian institutions at different
            granularities: overall, discipline-wise and thematic area wise. It also provides statistics and
            analysis about social media attention of Indian research output, open access levels and patterns
            in Indian research and participation of women in research. The portal is easy to use and can
            produce customizable results for individual or a group of institutions for any selected time period.
            <br>The portal uses scientometric data from Web of Science and uses state of the art scientometric,
            computational and machine learning techniques for discipline-wise and thematic area wise research
            performance mapping of Indian institutions. The portal can thus be used for a variety of purposes:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>to understand overall research performance of India as a country and its relative position
                with other countries of the world,
            </li>
            <li>to get a research performance assessment of Indian institutions at overall, subject-level and thematic
                area levels,
