			A higher ratio of women in Higher Education and research is a very important development goal in many
			countries across the world. There are many countries which provides special initiatives and schemes to
			increase participation of women in education. The 2030 agenda for
			<a href="https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/post2015/transformingourworld" target="_blank">Sustainable
				Development</a>
			by United Nations lists seventeen development goals, which includes -</p>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Goal 4</b>: Ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning
				oppurtunities for all.
			</li>
			<li><b>Goal 5</b>: Achieve gender equality and empower all women girls.</li>
		</ul>
		<p class="text-justify">
			But even after so much efforts, according to UNESCO Institute for Statistics
			<a href="http://uis.unesco.org/sites/default/files/documents/fs51-women-in-science-2018-en.pdf"
			   target="_blank">
				fact sheet</a>
			2018, women account for less than 30% of the total researchers across the world. India has taken several
			initiatives to enhance enrollment of women in higher education and research. According to data from
			University Grants Commission of India, women accounted for about 48% of the total enrolment in higher
			education institutions in the year 2016-17. Out of all Ph.D.s awarded in 2015-16, women account for
			about 39% degrees awarded. According to a report by Department of Science and Technology of India,
			as on 2015 there are about 14% women out of total full-time personnel engaged in R&D activities in the
			country. Similarly, women participation in extramural research projects supported by central and
			state government funding bodies has been about 29% as in 2014-153.
			<br>
			Here, a case study was made to characterize the participation of women in research, by analysing
			the parameters of institution-type, discipline, citation impact and international collaboration.
			Research publication data from 50 most productive Indian institutions, along with data for 5 major
			institution systems, for a period of 10 years (2008–2017), as indexed in Web of Science, is obtained
			as sample data and analysed.

			The second aspect analysed in the Indian research output data was to see if there exist
			disciplinary differences in the levels of participation of women in research publishing.
			As explained earlier, this was done by grouping the data into 14 broad disciplines through a

		<ul style="columns: 2">
			<li>Agriculture (AGR)</li>
			<li>Art & Humanities (AH)</li>

			It can be observed that disciplines like AGR, BIO, MED, MUL and SS have more than 30% of the total
			research output with female lead authors. On the contrary, disciplines like ENG and INF have about
			80% of the papers with male authors, i.e. only 20% papers with female authors.
			<br>
			Ratio-wise, BIO leads with a value of 0.58, follwed by AGR and MED (0.47). ENG, INF and MAT has values of
			0.26 and 0.28 for a female to male authored paper ratio.The case of lower participation of women in INF
			is particularly surprising, as it is often believed that Computer Science and IT careers are more
			suitable to women.

			Looking at Year-wise values of female to male authored paper ratio, AGR and MED disciplines show

			Here we see, University of Delhi has the highest female to male authored paper ratio of 0.70 as well as percentage
			(41%) of female authored papers. Other institutions with reasonably good amount of female authored
			papers are Jawaharlal Nehru University (39.2%), University of Pune (36.6%), Manipal University (35.5%),
			University of Calcutta (35.6%) and Panjab University (33.5%).
			<br>
			The premier technological institutions of the country, on the other hand, have much lesser percentage
			of female authored papers, with IIT Bombay having 22.1%, IIT Madras having 20.8% and IIT Kanpur
			having 18.83% of female authored papers. These technological institutions also have one of the lowest
			female to male authored papers ratio, ranging around 0.2.
		</p>
		<p class="text-justify">
			There are two important points to notice in these results. First, female to male research output
			ratio is not seen to be better for institutions located in big metropolitan cities, as seen in the
			case of IITs located in Bombay and Madras. At the same time some institutions located in smaller
			cities like Allahabad, Varanasi, Vellore etc. have higher female participation in research, as
			measured from output. Therefore, it cannot be said that institutions located in big metropolitan
			cities are likely to have higher female participation in research.
			<br>
			The second aspect is to analyse the disciplinary focus of the institution and its female authored
			research output levels. From the data, it has been observed that institutions that have multiple
			disciplines being pursued in them are relatively better in levels of female participation in research.
			Institutions focusing mainly in Biological Science, Medical Science, Social Science and Arts & Humanities
			also have better female participation as compared to other institutions.
		</p>
		<p class="text-justify">
			Another northworthy result was also analysed from the data, namely the differentiation in citation
			impact of female and male authored papers.For this purpose, the research output data for female and
			male authored papers were put in two sets. Thereafter, the year-wise values of Citations Per Paper
			(CPP) are computed by dividing the total citations by total papers for that year. The objective was
			to find out if female authored papers attract more, less or similar citations per paper as that of
			male authored papers.

			It is observed that female authored papers have lower CPP values than male authored papers during
			the whole 10-year period. The average CPP value for the whole period for female authored papers is
			11.68 as compared to 13.26 for male authored papers.
			<br>
			The last point of analysis was to find out if female researchers collaborate internationally more or
			less as compared to the male researchers. It is observed that female authored papers have higher
			ratio of Internationally Collaborated Papers (ICP) for the whole period, except in two years
			(2014 and 2017). The 10-year average value for ICP proportion for female-authored papers is 10.45
			as compared to 9.44 for male-authored papers. Though the difference in values of ICP proportion of
			female and male authored papers is not much, female authors are found to have an edge in the ability
			to form more international collaborations as compared to male authors.
